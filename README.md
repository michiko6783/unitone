I set up a basic html layout adding a bootstrap grid, image carousel and navbar.
    I decided to use a fixed navbar that would stay at the top of the page while scrolling and
    a simple bootstrap carousel for my images. 

The grid layout is set for lg, md and xs devices at col-lg-4, col-md-4 and col-xs-12.

Since I do not have any complete projects for presentation I took liberty to make the All About Me just that:
    included is family, hobbies and other talents of mine including work from my previous career.
