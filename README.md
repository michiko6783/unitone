I set up a basic html layout adding a bootstrap grid, image carousel and navbar.
    I decided to use a fixed navbar that would stay at the top of the page while scrolling and
    a simple bootstrap carousel for my images. 

The grid layout is set for lg, md and xs devices at col-lg-4, col-md-4 and col-xs-12.

Since I do not have any complete projects for presentation I took liberty to make the All About Me just that:
    included is family, hobbies and other talents of mine including work from my previous career.

With help, got the toggle navbar working and managed to get the background image to show. 
Successfully linked the navbar to the pages sections so they hide/show upon click though they dont scroll currently.

Modified font style to 'Gloria Hallelujah', cursive.
still having a hard time figuring out the margins that are not budging but have made them rather opaque.

Added more pictures for hobbies and career.

after finishing all three sections with text and photo galleries, 
I added a carousel at the bottom with some of my favorite nerdy quotes that inspire me for times of difficulty.

the submit field for the email does have an alert box if not filled out and the button is pushed but it is not
currently linked to anything. 

overall it still has plenty of work but a good start for a simple single page layout.
